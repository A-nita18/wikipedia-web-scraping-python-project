# Top American Companies Data Scraper

This project uses **Python** in **Jupyter Notebooks** to scrape data from **Wikipedia** about the top American companies.  
The goal is to extract relevant company information, organize it into a **Pandas DataFrame**, and export the results to a **CSV file** for further analysis.

## Overview

The notebook automates the process of:
- Accessing Wikipedia pages using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Extracting key company data such as name, industry, and revenue
- Cleaning and structuring the data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Saving the dataset as a `.csv` file for future analysis or visualization

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **BeautifulSoup4**
- **Requests**
- **Pandas**

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Practiced web scraping fundamentals and HTML parsing  
- Strengthened data cleaning and transformation skills
